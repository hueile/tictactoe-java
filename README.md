# tictactoe-java
A simple TicTacToe game implemented in Java

**AIPlayer: This AI uses Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Ideally this AI player will never lose due to the nature of Minimax.**
**AIPlayer2: This Ai uses Monte Carlo Tree Search. It will run 1000 simulations to determine the best move.**
**HumanPlayer: The human player. Does not get simpler :)**

To choose which player will be playing, you can modify the code in the TicTacToe.java file. * *(You can have 2 AI players playing against each other)* *
